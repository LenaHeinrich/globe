## HTTPsniff
(cc) Luis Rodil-Fern&aacute;ndez

A generic http sniffer for a custom-built WiFi access point. Made for Interaction Design Arnhem.

Scapy and libpcap are used for sniffing and they need Kernel mode access, so you must run with sudo. Like so:

```
$ sudo ./sniff.py
```

_Remember you do not have to type the '$' sign_
